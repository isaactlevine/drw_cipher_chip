# Longer description of how the project works
long_description: |
  This project implements a Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) based cipher
  that encodes Chinese characters. It uses an array of ring oscillators to generate
  unique responses based on manufacturing variations. These responses are then used
  to encode characters from the phrase "莫见乎隐，莫显乎微".

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
testing_instructions: |
  1. Apply clock signal to io_in[0]
  2. Apply reset signal to io_in[1]
  3. Apply a 4-bit challenge to io_in[5:2]
  4. Read the lower 8 bits of the encoded character from io_out[7:0]
  5. Observe how the encoded output changes with different challenges and over time
